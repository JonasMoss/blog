## Introduction

You have to psychometric instruments, $\hat{Z_1}$ and $\hat{Z_2}$, measuring the true scores $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ with error. The estimators are linear in $Z_1,Z_2$ with independent error terms, i.e. $\hat{Z_1} = Z_1 + \epsilon_1$ and $\hat{Z_2} = Z_2 + \epsilon_2$. You only observe the correlation between the measurements $\hat{Z_1}$ and $\hat{Z_2}$, but you're interested in the correlation between the true scores $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. What should you do? The Spearman [@Spearman1904-zu] attenuation formula states that $$\operatorname{Cor}(Z_1, Z_2) = \frac{\operatorname{Cor}(\hat{Z_1}, \hat{Z_2})}{\operatorname{Cor}(Z_1,\hat{Z_1})\operatorname{Cor}(Z_2,\hat{Z_2})}$$ {#eq-spearman}

### Single and double corrections

The Spearman attenuation formula does a \*double correction\* as it's a formula for the correlation between both true scores $Z_1$ and \$Z_2\$. But it's also possible to calculate the correlation between and estimator $\hat{Z}_1$ and the true score $Z_2$. Then the single correction formula states

$$\operatorname{Cor}(\hat{Z}_1, Z_2) = \frac{\operatorname{Cor}(\hat{Z_1}, \hat{Z_2})}{\operatorname{Cor}(Z_2,\hat{Z_2}).}$$ {#eq-spearman-single} The motivation for using the single correction is simple enough. The correlation between two variables quantifies how well you can predict one from the other. If you want to predict the true score, say intelligence, from an estimated score of openness, the single prediction formula should be used [@Guilford1954-si, p. 401; cited in @Muchinsky1996-zr].

## Inference
There are some factors that make inference difficult:

1. **Different sample sizes.** The sample sizes $n_1,n_2,n_3$ for the two reliabilities and the correlation in the numerator can be different. This should be taken into account when constructing confidence intervals.
2. **Which reliability method was used?** Different reliability methods will not have the same asymptotic variance.  
3. **What kind of model assumptions can we make?** Simple asymptotics for the most commonly used reliability coefficient, coefficient alpha, is only available for pseudo-elliptically distributed variables under the parallel model. But in order to use that, we must know the common kurtosis coefficient in addition to the value of alpha, and the that is never reported. The asymptotically distribution-free interval is consistent in general, but is almost never used. If we assume multivariate normality and the parallel model, the asymptotics of coefficient alpha is simple though, depending only on the value of coefficient alpha itself.

## The @Hakstian1988-gz paper

The authors take a look at an estimator that looks slightly different from what I am used to. Citing @Rogers1976-rc, they employ the formula

$$\hat{\rho}(Z_{1},Z_{2})=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\left[\hat{\rho}(\hat{Z}_{1}^{1},\hat{Z}_{2}^{1})+\hat{\rho}(\hat{Z}_{1}^{2},\hat{Z}_{2}^{2})\right]}{\hat{\rho}(Z_{1},\hat{Z}_{1})\hat{\rho}(Z_{2},\hat{Z}_{2})}$${#eq-hakstian1988}
where $\hat{\rho}$ denotes an estimator of the correlation. The correlations in the denominator can't be estimated directly, but the correlations in the numerator can.

In other words, the estimator of the correlation is a mean of two independently obtained estimators of the correlation. They do not mention the problem of different $n_1$ and $n_2$.
