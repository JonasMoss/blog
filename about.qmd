I'm Jonas Moss, a statistics post doc at BI Norwegian Business School. I'm interested in programming, the replication crisis in psychology, theoretical statistics, forecasting, [effective altruism](www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org), and rationalism (as in [Lesswrong](https://www.lesserwrong.com/)).
